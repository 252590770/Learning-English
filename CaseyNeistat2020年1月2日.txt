    pretty what does it say

    so I woke up  this morning a 38 year old guy who's

    married and has three kids

    when did that happen

    are you older    are you young

    how old are you

    time is not equal the older you get

    the faster it moves

    I just mean that

    when  you think of the the scope of your life

    that's a unit of time

    we all understand   uniquely

    I'm 38 I know what 38 years  means 

    and 1 year as a percentage of   that is pretty small

    so we all get

    one lifetime this is  the constant

    no matter

    who you are how long you live

    you only  get one lifetime

    in a year

    the years that make up a lifetime

    well this  becomes the variable

    I'm 38 she's 5

    I've got 38 years Bernie's five five  years

    so as a percentage of my whole

    a year is only 2.6 percent of that life

    but for Franny who's five one year for

    her is 20 percent of her life

    a year for me is seven times faster than a year for her

    remember being a little kid remember

    how long a year seemed

    it was like an eternity

    now think back to last year

    and the thing that I've only recently

    the thing that I've recently come to  appreciate is

    how much of that life you

    spend focusing on the future

    versus  focusing on the past

    this is my notebook from 2003
     
    this crazy  chart here

    it's just labeled dominate

    and it's my my plan to dominate in life written in 2003 

    now I was young

    then I had accomplished very little

    so when I thought of my life

    when I took inventory of what

    my life was it was largely aspirational is about

    where I wanted to be in the future

    not what I'd done in the past 

    so this is life 

    this is where you start 
 
    this is where you end

    and this is me

    a life is defined by the things you've done in the past 

    as well as the  things you aspire to do in the future

    looking ahead looking back

    and as I grew up

    especially as it became like a teenager

    and when I moved to New York City

    I realized that what define me were my aspirations

    were the things that I wanted for myself in the future

    so if you imagine me in nineteen year old me

    and saying 19 or old case he'd tell me  about yourself

    I wouldn't have talked  about my past 

    I wouldn't have talked about the c-minus

    I got in 10th grade  English other than a job that

    I hated  her that I lived in a tiny apartment with three roommates

    I would have talked about my future

    the things I wanted to do the life

    I wanted to build my dream my aspiration

    I lived in that future and

    that's what defined me  that

    started  looking back

    I realize I've accumulated  a lot in life in my in my 20s

    I've accumulated so much that defined who 

    I was I was still largely defined by my aspirations

    but my past started to started to feel like it was contributing

    to who I was then

    and now I find myself here I'm almost 40

    I've lived through my 20s

    I've lived through my 30s

    and I slept my  aspirations

    but so much of Who I am has been defined by my past now

    oh my god

    leaving high school leaving my parents house

    having a kid

    moving to New York

    September 11th

    that's 20 year old Casey

    riding my bike up the Westside Highway

    to get away from the towers

    getting my first real job

    quitting my first real job being single

    meeting Candice getting married

    starting  a family

    I feel like a dozen years of trying finally figuring out my career

    I'm starting a proper and daily vlog

    that fear and uncertainty that that

    really defines early adulthood all of  that  is in my past life

    life is this  freight train and it  leaves the station slowly

    but it picks up momentum and it goes faster and faster and faster

    and then you wake up

    one day and it's 2020 and 

    you're not a kid anymore 

    and you become that adult

    that you remember when you were kid

    you remember looking at thinking

    I'll never be that old 

    but you will be that old and

    there's nothing there's nothing

    you can  do to change that

    happy 91st birthday there thank you

    sweetheart what would I do without you

    KC how does it feel to be 91

    she was my hero that was my grandmother

    when she was a kid

    she discovered her love for dancing

    that was her passion her dreams

    she realized it her whole life

    and I remember vividly having this conversation with her just before she died

    just after that video of her birthday was taking place

    we're in her  dance studio

    the walls are covered in pictures from her career

    like her performing for the troops during World War two

    her on Broadway in the late 1930s

    and I said to her

    I said Nana

    your life has been so  exceptional

    your past so extraordinary

    but what do you think about in terms of your life

    when you think about the future

    Nana which of your upcoming birthdays

    would you say you're looking forward to the most 

    and she said in her infinite  wisdom

    I don't think about the future

    and then she said and 

    this is the point

    this is the point of all

    and then she said

    but but when I wake up in the morning

    I'm so grateful to have one more  day 

    that that is what I focus on

    I focus  on right now

    I try to think about that every day

    I try to think about that every day

    when I wake up

    I know from experience that spending too much  energy

    romanticizing the past

    or dreaming about  the future

    can come at the expense of appreciating today

    and I'm not 92 years old

    and I hope I've got a long long future ahead of me 

    but I don't know what

    I do know is that I've got right now 

    and  that's pretty great

    I've said it before and I'll say it again

    life moves pretty fast if you don't stop 

    and look around once in a while

    you might just miss it I said it before

    and I'll say it again 

    life moves pretty fast

    you don't stop and look  around 

    once in a while you could miss it you
